# owf-data-co-municipalities #

This repository contains the [Open Water Foundation (OWF)](http://openwaterfoundation.org) dataset for Colorado municipalities.
This is a foundational dataset that provides unique identifiers and other data for municipalities.
The identifiers can be used to link other datasets, such as water providers.
OWF has created and is maintaining this dataset to facilitate work on various data analysis and visualization projects in Colorado.

## How to Use the Data ##

The Colorado municipalities dataset provides a complete statewide list of municipalities assembled from multiple sources.
There are several unique identifiers for each municipality and the dataset allows cross-referencing the identifiers
so that other datasets can be joined.
For example, the [Colorado water providers dataset](owf-data-co-municipal-water-providers) dataset uses the municipalities'
identifiers to indicate which municipalities a water provider serves.

The Excel or csv forms can be used as tabular datasets as is, or to link to other datasets.

## License ##

The license is being determined.
All the data are public so there are not really any restrictions on use.

## Contributing ##

The Open Water Foundation is currently working on an initial release of the dataset to support a
data visualization project in the South Platte Basin of Colorado.
If you use the dataset and have comments, please contact the maintainers and/or use the GitHub issues to provide feedback.
