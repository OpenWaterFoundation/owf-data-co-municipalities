# x-visualizations

This folder contains an old version of a simple application to view the layer using Leaflet.

Currently, the layer is used in production applications such as the
[Poudre Basin Information](https://poudre.openwaterfoundation.org) website and the
[dataset landing page](https://data.openwaterfoundation.org/state/co/municipalities/)
provides a link to view the layer.
